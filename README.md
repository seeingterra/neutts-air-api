*Created by [Neuphonic](http://neuphonic.com/) - building faster, smaller, on-device voice AI*

State-of-the-art Voice AI has been locked behind web APIs for too long. NeuTTS Air is the world‚Äôs first super-realistic, on-device, TTS speech language model with instant voice cloning. Built off a 0.5B LLM backbone, NeuTTS Air brings natural-sounding speech, real-time performance, built-in security and speaker cloning to your local device - unlocking a new category of embedded voice agents, assistants, toys, and compliance-safe apps.

## Key Features

- üó£Best-in-class realism for its size - produces natural, ultra-realistic voices that sound human
- üì±Optimised for on-device deployment - provided in GGML format, ready to run on phones, laptops, or even Raspberry Pis
- üë´Instant voice cloning - create your own speaker with as little as 3 seconds of audio
- üöÑSimple LM + codec architecture built off a 0.5B backbone - the sweet spot between speed, size, and quality for real-world applications

## Model Details

NeuTTS Air is built off Qwen 0.5B - a lightweight yet capable language model optimised for text understanding and generation - as well as a powerful combination of technologies designed for efficiency and quality:

- **Audio Codec**: [NeuCodec](https://huggingface.co/neuphonic/neucodec) - our proprietary neural audio codec that achieves exceptional audio quality at low bitrates using a single codebook
- **Format**: Available in GGML format for efficient on-device inference
- **Responsibility**: Watermarked outputs
- **Inference Speed**: Real-time generation on mid-range devices
- **Power Consumption**: Optimised for mobile and embedded devices

## Get Started

1. **Clone Git Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/neutts-air.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd neuttsair
   ```

2. **Install `espeak` (required dependency)**

   Please refer to the following link for instructions on how to install `espeak`:

   https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/guide.md

   ```bash
   # Mac OS
   brew install espeak

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install espeak
   ```

   Mac users may need to put the following lines at the top of the neutts.py file.
   ```python
   from phonemizer.backend.espeak.wrapper import EspeakWrapper
   _ESPEAK_LIBRARY = '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/espeak/1.48.04_1/lib/libespeak.1.1.48.dylib'  #use the Path to the library.
   EspeakWrapper.set_library(_ESPEAK_LIBRARY)
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**

   The requirements file includes the dependencies needed to run the model with PyTorch.
   When using an ONNX decoder or a GGML model, some dependencies (such as PyTorch) are no longer required.

   The inference is compatible and tested on `python>=3.11`.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **(Optional) Install Llama-cpp-python to use the `GGUF` models.**
   ```
   pip install llama-cpp-python
   ```
   To run llama-cpp with GPU suport (CUDA, MPS) support please refer to:
   https://pypi.org/project/llama-cpp-python/

5. **(Optional) Install onnxruntime to use the `.onnx` decoder.**
   If you wnat to run the onnxdecoder
   ```
   pip install onnxruntime
   ```

## Basic Example

Run the basic example script to synthesize speech:
```bash
python -m examples.basic_example \
  --input_text "My name is Dave, and um, I'm from London" \
  --ref_audio samples/dave.wav \
  --ref_text samples/dave.txt
```

To specify a particular model repo for the backbone or codec, add the `--backbone` argument. Available backbones are listed in [NeuTTS-Air huggingface collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/neuphonic/neutts-air-68cc14b7033b4c56197ef350).

Several examples are available, including a Jupyter notebook in the `examples` folder.

### Simple One-Code Block Usage

```python
from neuttsair.neutts import NeuTTSAir
import soundfile as sf

tts = NeuTTSAir( backbone_repo="neuphonic/neutts-air-q4-gguf", backbone_device="cpu", codec_repo="neuphonic/neucodec", codec_device="cpu")
input_text = "My name is Dave, and um, I'm from London."

ref_text = "samples/dave.txt"
ref_audio_path = "samples/dave.wav"

ref_text = open(ref_text, "r").read().strip()
ref_codes = tts.encode_reference(ref_audio_path)

wav = tts.infer(input_text, ref_codes, ref_text)
sf.write("test.wav", wav, 24000)
```


## Advanced Examples
### GGML Backbone Example
```bash
python -m examples.basic_example \
  --input_text "My name is Dave, and um, I'm from London" \
  --ref_audio ./samples/dave.wav \
  --ref_text ./samples/dave.txt \
  --backbone neuphonic/neutts-air-q4-gguf
```

### Onnx Decoder Example

Make sure you have installed ```onnxruntime```

```bash
python -m examples.onnx_example \
  --input_text "My name is Dave, and um, I'm from London" \
  --ref_codes samples/dave.pt \
  --ref_text samples/dave.txt
```

To run the model with the onnx decoder you need to encode the reference sample. Please refer to the encode_reference example.

#### Encode reference
You only need to provide a reference audio for the reference encoding.

```bash
python -m examples.encode_reference \
 --ref_audio  ./samples/dave.wav \
 --output_path encoded_reference.pt
 ```

## Prepare References for Cloning

NeuTTS Air requires two inputs:

1. A reference audio sample (`.wav` file)
2. A text string

The model then synthesises the text as speech in the style of the reference audio. This is what enables NeuTTS Air‚Äôs instant voice cloning capability.

### Example Reference Files

You can find some ready-to-use samples in the `examples` folder:

- `samples/dave.wav`
- `samples/jo.wav`

### Guidelines for Best Results

For optimal performance, reference audio samples should be:

1. **Mono channel**
2. **16-44 kHz sample rate**
3. **3‚Äì15 seconds in length**
4. **Saved as a `.wav` file**
5. **Clean** ‚Äî minimal to no background noise
6. **Natural, continuous speech** ‚Äî like a monologue or conversation, with few pauses, so the model can capture tone effectively

## Responsibility

Every audio file generated by NeuTTS Air includes [Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth).

## Disclaimer

Don't use this model to do bad things‚Ä¶ please.
